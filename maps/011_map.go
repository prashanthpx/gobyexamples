/*
Code Explanation:
- Purpose: Demonstrate concurrent map access with synchronization and logical overwrite behavior
- Two goroutines run in loops protected by a mutex:
  - G1: acquires lock and reinitializes processedMap[key] to a new empty inner map
  - G2: acquires lock and writes processedMap[key]["controller-A"] = true
- Because G1 overwrites the inner map repeatedly, G2â€™s writes can be lost between iterations
- The mutex ensures there is no data race on the maps, but the logic still leads to non-deterministic output and lost updates
- The program blocks forever (select {}), so it prints continuously
