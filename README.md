# Go by Examples and Mistakes

A practical, one-stop guide for ramping from basic to advanced Go using runnable examples and real-world mistakes.

- Start here: [GUIDES.md](GUIDES.md)
- Quick lookup: [MISTAKES_INDEX.md](MISTAKES_INDEX.md)

How to run examples:
- go run path/to/example.go
- go test -race ./...
- go vet ./...

Contributions welcome. Keep examples small, compilable, and paired with fixes when demonstrating mistakes.
